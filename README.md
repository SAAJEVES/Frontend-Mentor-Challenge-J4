## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Finally learnt how to use svg files as background image and also the little adjustment needed to cleary show the SVG file when it is use as background with a color. I actually did overthink it but it turned out so simple but technical

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<body> 
  <div class="wrapper"> 
    <section>
    </section>
  </div>

</body>
```
```css
.wrapper {
    background: url(bg-curve-mobile.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: top;
    padding-top: 40px;
}

section {
    background-color: var(--lg--blue);
}

```



### Continued development

There are much to learn on html and css. Hopefully, I will learn as much as I can.

### Useful resources

A lot of resources was helpful not just in this project but from the beginning of my learning of web development.

- And lots more. Surely, I will always recommend them days in and days out
